\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{ch:conclusions}
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum

%abbiamo notato che i risultati sono meno stabili del più blasonato PPO questo perchè ovviamente c'è bisogno di raffinare l'architettura e i parametri

%Another reason could be the fact that the skills used so far mostly track moving objects, which in Breakout are the ball and the bar. The agent may therefore have little or no information about the bricks, which are a static part of the frame.


%First of all, we have shown that the quality of the training data is crucial for the performance of the agent.
%In particular, in \textit{Breakout} the agent struggled to learn the environment because the training data was not representative of the test data.
%Another limitation of our work is the lack of hyperparameter search.
%We believe that the performance of the agents could be further improved by tuning the hyperparameters, and this is something that we will consider in future work.
%We have shown that our approach is effective with PPO and DQL, but we have not tested other RL algorithms.
%We believe that our approach is general and can be applied to other algorithms, and this is something that we will consider in future work.
%Lastly there are some limitations in the explainability of our approach.
%We have shown that the WSA module can provide insights on how the agent uses the FMs to make decisions, but we have not provided a complete analysis of the explainability of our approach.
%This is something that we will consider in future work.

%In our work, we used pre-trained models provided by the authors of the paper, and we did not perform any hyperparameter search.
%The quality of the pre-trained models can influence the performance of the agent, and a better quality of the pre-trained models can lead to better performance of the agent.
