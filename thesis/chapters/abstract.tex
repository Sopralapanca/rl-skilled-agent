\begin{abstract}
In this work, we present a technique for deep reinforcement learning that, through the use of different state representations, is able to combine different features in order to create an enhanced feature rapresentation.
Instead of directly learning a policy from raw input, the agent uses pre-trained foundational models which are capable of extracting features of various forms.
